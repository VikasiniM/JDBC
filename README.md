# JDBC Student Management App

JDBC is a Java API that allows Java programs to interact with relational databases. This project leverages JDBC to create a comprehensive student management system that can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student records stored in a database.

## Key Features

- Connect to a database using JDBC and establish a connection with the database server.
- Create tables to store student information using SQL statements.
- Implement functionality to add, retrieve, update, and delete student records in the database.
- Build a user-friendly command-line interface for interacting with the application.
- Utilize JDBC prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks and enhance security.
- Perform database CRUD operations with persistance in a running database server.


## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/jdbc-student-management-app.git 

```

2. Open the project in your favorite Java IDE.

3. Configure your database connection details in the code, including the database URL, username, and password in a environment variable file (.env).

4. Run the application and interact with the command-line interface to perform CRUD operations on student records.

## Available Commands

1. **ADD** - Add a new student to the database.
               

3. **DELETE** - Delete a student from the database.
   

4. **UPDATE** - Update a student in the database.


6. **DISPLAY** - Display all students in the database.
